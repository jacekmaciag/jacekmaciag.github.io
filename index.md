A dedicated and scrupulous (a perfectionist) tester with experience in API, frontend and mobile testing. 
Having started my career with Java language and Selenium automation, over the years I was able to add to gain experience
with Python, Ruby, Javascript & SQL and technologies such as Spring, Flask.

I believe in:
* knowledge is power
* communication is key to problem solving

In my free time I enjoy algorithm and problem solving. I also develop a personal project - 
a distributed system for automated commodities/forex trading named
*[**Opes**](https://github.com/search?q=Jdelorean%2Fopes&type=Repositories)* 
which is based on Java and Spring Boot.
